# My J2EE

## J2EE project ideas

Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE), now known as Jakarta EE, is a powerful platform for developing enterprise-level applications.

1. **Online Shopping Portal**: Develop a web-based application for an online shopping platform. This project can include features like user authentication, product catalog management, shopping cart functionality, order processing, and payment integration using servlets, JSP, JDBC for database connectivity, and possibly frameworks like Spring or Hibernate for easier development.

2. **Employee Management System**: Build a comprehensive system for managing employee data within an organization. This can involve modules for employee profiles, attendance tracking, leave management, payroll processing, and reporting functionalities. You can use servlets, JSP, JDBC, and possibly EJBs for this project.

3. **Hospital Management System**: Design a system to manage various aspects of a hospital, such as patient records, doctor schedules, appointment booking, billing, and inventory management. Servlets, JSP, JDBC, and frameworks like Spring could be used to implement this project.

4. **Social Networking Platform**: Create a social networking application where users can create profiles, connect with friends, share updates, send messages, and join communities or groups. This project would involve servlets, JSP, JDBC, and possibly technologies like WebSockets for real-time communication.

5. **Online Banking System**: Develop an online banking application with features like user authentication, account management, funds transfer, transaction history, and account statements. Servlets, JSP, JDBC, and security features like SSL/TLS for secure communication can be utilized here.

6. **Inventory Management System**: Build a system for managing inventory for a retail or manufacturing business. This can include functionalities for tracking stock levels, managing suppliers, generating purchase orders, and analyzing sales data. Servlets, JSP, JDBC, and possibly frameworks like Spring could be used for this project.

7. **E-learning Platform**: Create an e-learning platform where users can access courses, view instructional materials, submit assignments, take quizzes, and track their progress. Servlets, JSP, JDBC, and possibly technologies like RESTful APIs for integrating with learning management systems could be employed here.

8. **Travel Booking System**: Develop a system for booking flights, hotels, and rental cars for travelers. This project can include features like searching for available options, making reservations, managing bookings, and generating itineraries. Servlets, JSP, JDBC, and possibly APIs from travel service providers could be used.

9. **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System**: Build a CRM system to help businesses manage interactions with current and potential customers. This can include functionalities for managing contacts, tracking communication history, scheduling appointments, and analyzing customer data. Servlets, JSP, JDBC, and possibly frameworks like Spring could be employed here.

10. **Event Management System**: Design a system for organizing and managing events, such as conferences, seminars, or concerts. This project can include features for event registration, ticket booking, attendee management, scheduling, and logistics planning. Servlets, JSP, JDBC, and possibly frameworks like Spring could be used for this project.

These project ideas cover a wide range of domains and can be tailored to fit the learning objectives of your J2EE course. They offer opportunities to practice various J2EE technologies and best practices while building practical, real-world applications.

## Create an Event Management System

### 1. Java Files Placement

- **Entities/Models**: Place your Java classes representing entities like `Event`, `User`, etc., in the appropriate package under `primary-source/src/main/java`.
- **EJBs (Enterprise JavaBeans)**: For business logic and services, place your EJB classes under `ejbs/src/main/java`.
- **Servlets**: For handling HTTP requests, place your servlet classes under `servlets/servlet/src/main/java`.
- **Listeners, Filters, etc.**: Place any other Java classes like listeners or filters in appropriate packages according to their functionality.

### 2. Web Resources

- **JSP Files**: Place your JSP files under `servlets/servlet/src/main/webapp`.
- **Static Resources (CSS, JavaScript)**: Place static resources like CSS and JavaScript under `servlets/servlet/src/main/webapp`.
- **WEB-INF Configuration**: Place `web.xml` under `servlets/servlet/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF` for servlet mappings, filters, listeners, etc.

### 3. Configuration

- **pom.xml**: Configure your `pom.xml` in the root directory accordingly. Ensure that dependencies for Java EE APIs, such as servlet-api, JSP API, EJB API, etc., are included.
- **web.xml**: Configure `web.xml` to define servlet mappings, filters, and listeners as per your application's requirements.

### Detailed Steps

1. Define your entity classes (e.g., `Event.java`, `User.java`) under `primary-source/src/main/java`.
2. Implement business logic/services using EJBs in `ejbs/src/main/java`.
3. Create servlets to handle HTTP requests under `servlets/servlet/src/main/java`.
4. Place JSP files, CSS, JavaScript, etc., under `servlets/servlet/src/main/webapp`.
5. Configure servlet mappings, filters, and listeners in `web.xml` under `servlets/servlet/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF`.
6. Update your `pom.xml` in the root directory to include necessary dependencies and plugins for building and packaging your application.
7. Build your project using Maven: `mvn clean install`.
8. Deploy your generated EAR file from the `ear/target` directory to your Java EE application server (e.g., Apache TomEE, WildFly).

Ensure that you follow standard Java EE practices and adhere to the specific requirements of your Event Management System while implementing functionality and designing your application's architecture.
